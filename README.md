## nqueenAI

An additional lab in the [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree program](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd889/syllabus), designed to attempt the [Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). The original repository is available from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/AIND-Constraint_Satisfaction).

To do this, we had to define code dealing with **Constraint Propogation**, implemented here in a Jupyter Notebook. 

### Setup

This project requires Python 3 (Preferably as distributed by [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)).

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook Constraint_Satisfaction.ipynb

The methods haven't all been implemented, but the attemps are ongoing!
